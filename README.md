Clouded Plain

Clouds drifting in layers over plain

Clouds are cell-manifesting agents
Plain is field of cells.


Like Blanketflower but better. Suaver design. Faster. Has sound. Smoother.

Cloud

  void setPlain(plain)

  manifest
    Derive t from plain
    Add values for all cells in plain where cloud is present. 
    Usually that value is 1. Sometimes 2 if we want to illustrate area-overlap or a secon-level effect or something.

  boolean isFinished
    Used to tell the system to discard this cloud because it's done


-----

clouds are time-parametric cell pattern generators

plain is an array of cells

clouds are graphically mixed by summing manifestations in cells and then using that value to get a color from a palette-array

sound is derived by examining plain. Get all the colored shapes. Translate colors into tones.
ex : shape color = waveform. area = frequency. Closeness to field center = volume. Gangliness = vibrato


---------------
It's a tiled-image and sculpted-tone audio-video mixer-generator

The plain is a field of tiles

The clouds are tile-value expressors
They are instantiated, do their dance, then are discarded

The cloud expresses a pattern of tile values, to be summed for each tile. 
That value means the tile's color.
The audio is derived from the various shapes formed by colored masses of tiles.
(or however we want to do it)

-----------------

We have 2 rates to consider
frame rate and audio sample rate
both will be derived from a fundamental tick. Tick frequency will be some really high audio sample rate I guess.


-------------------
try different resolutions for the plain. Fine and coarse.

---------------------

can clouds interact?
spawn more clouds?
